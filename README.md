# CharacterChecker
In MIPS

The objective of this project was to count how many times certain characters were seen in an user inputted string. The characters were P,E,G,A,S,O,I,and D. These characters were counted whether upper or lower case. The function was made without using any special MIPS instructions. I calculated the energy consumption and clocks per instruction of the code. Then i improved the programâ€™s energy consumption by 10% by using more efficient branch statements and .data values. The file you see is the optimized code.
